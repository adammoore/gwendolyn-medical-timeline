            Gwen has a documented history of both central and obstructive sleep apnoea, ventilation, and respiratory arrests. 
            These can occur both day and night and will occur for the rest of her life. She has had at least 5 risk of death 
            full respiratory arrests, including prolonged periods of mechanically assisted breathing. Most of her early childhood 
            was spent with CPAP assisted ventilation at night, due to frequent apnoea and a continuing risk of death. She has had 
            upper and lower respiratory infections - suffering a critical risk of death incident following an RSV infection. She 
            has also had collapsed lungs due to respiratory complications. Any simple procedures required authorisation by aneathits 
            consultant. She recently failed a fit to fly test – requiring 2l flow of oxygen for anything but the very shortest of 
            flights She has now been weaned off ventilation but owing to deterioration her paediatrician has requested another sleep 
            study- she remains under specialist respiratory and sleep teams. Her respiratory health is supported by prophylactic 
            antibiotics (Azithromycin)

            Gwen experiences vomiting and reflux owing to gastric issues (including GERD) and her atypical anatomy, especially her 
            oval epiglottis which can lead to her needing to be tube fed, use thickeners or only drinking through a straw. Until 
            her reflux was under control, she was experiencing significant damage from reflux (stone cobbling burns observed) and 
            has a continually monitored medication regime now. For example, if she doesn't eat as soon as she wakes up she will 
            need antacid support to avoid reflux / vomiting. Although she has the cognitive ability to drink from a cup, she prefers 
            a straw to reduce the risk of choking. Gwen has significant dietary and behavioural complexities These require coordinated 
            specialist input (Endocrinology, Dietetics, CAMHS) and a high level of supervision at both home and school. Gwen is 
            currently classed as obese. This severely impacts her self-directed activities, movement around her family home and 
            interactions with peers. It impacts her pre-existing orthoperiodic conditions, Gwen has an obsession with food, which 
            manifests itself as impulsive grabbing of drink or food, based on opportunity. She requires constant supervision to make 
            sure neither her consumption nor her determination to overeat impact on herself or others. For example at a school 
            activity she drank out for the cup containing coffee and dairy from an instructor despite being warned not to. She was 
            very ill for 2 days afterwards. Also impacting her ability to intake food is her PICA – which means that if she's hungry 
            she'll try to chew the first thing available.

            She has undergone multiple major orthopaedic surgeries (osteotomy and patella stabilization) which were largely unsuccessful. 
            10 children in the UK at most have undergone the same knee surgery as her. Her anatomy is atypical (e.g., flat bones, only 
            partial kneecap, one leg longer than the other), causing persistent lower-limb instability and severe pain. Gwen does not 
            process / acknoewled pain in a particular way so thisw can be fdiofficukt She is pending further specialist surgery on both 
            legs in another unique procedure. Adult surgeons are being commissioned to create a once in a lifetime approach with the 
            children's complex need orthopaedic team to resetting her gait and give her a greater ability to move by removing her kneecap, 
            reshaping the socket and replacing her ligaments with donor ligaments and doing a further osteotomy to rotate her bones. 
            Gwen already had her ham string severed, and her ligaments moved, and her leg surgically broken and hip reshaped etc. Of her 
            approximately 12 procedures two have been major orthopaedic surgery performed by the Head of the orthopaedic complex needs 
            team and the Head of Orthopaedic Surgery at Alder Hey Children's Hospital (though she does also have treatment under other 
            hospitals owing to their specialisations, Alder Hey coordinates). Gwen regularly requires 2:1 assistance for transfers/positioning 
            to prevent harm or dislocation and relies on a bespoke NHS wheelchair. As she is a 2:1 lift she need specialised support 
            whenever outside of a safe location. Her lack of understanding of pain and PDA Profile means that the need for 2:1 support 
            is constant when outside of secure, familiar locations. For example if a fire emergency occurs in a location Gwen is in 2 
            people will need to ensure her safety. Most recently, neurology identified significant changes between her head and neck 
            joints, putting her at greater risk of injury.

            Continence remains a major concern, requiring timely intervention by specialist practitioners and constant monitoring by

            for by both the continence team and urology nurses. Recurrent UTIs and PDA-related avoidance behaviours worsen these issues. 
            Gwen also suffers from gynae infections and has had monthly bleeds on and off since she was approximately 7 years old, and 
            no capacity to change pads or manage personal hygiene. It is important that Gwen has consistent, personalised care that
