Considering limitations of not being able to consider use of prokinetics to improve\nGwendolyn's gastroesophageal reflux problem, | have changed my strategy and have\nincreased her omeprazole dose from the current 10 to 15mg daily. | have advised this to\nbe divided in morning and evening doses with a lesser dose of 5mg in the morning and a\nhigher dose of 10mg in the night-time, so as to possibly improve her night-time reflux. |\nhave also discussed the concerns regarding the long-term use of omeprazole, as\nGwendolyn's parents had already done some literature review on the internet. |\nmentioned that essentially long-term use of proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole\ndeprive our gut of good bacteria which need an acid medium to thrive. The side effect or\ncomplication would be risk of gastrointestinal infections and gastroenteritis. On the other\nhand, at present, Gwendolyn's reflux problem is causing more difficult issues and hence\nunder specialist supervision, | am happy for omeprazole to be continued longer. In the\nlong run, if Gwendolyn\u2019s reflux symptoms improve significantly, then we should be able to\neither wean her off or maintain her on a very low dose as need be.\n\n2. | also added Gaviscon to take 5m! four times a day with meals, which should function as a\nthickener and prevent easy vomiting.\n\n3. | have discussed limitations of using domperidone or other prokinetics in view of\nGwendolyn\u2019s known arrhythmia, even if it is not cardiovascular in origin.\n\n4. | have reassured Gwendolyn\u2019s parents to a good extent that overall, despite the vomiting,\nshe is growing quite well and maintaining excellent growth centiles. Of course, because\nof difficulties in night-time sleep and to avoid risks towards aspiration and other ENT-type\nissues, | am trying to manage with the available medications in the best way.\n\n5. We did discuss the option of assessing how bad the reflux is but we are in agreement that\nGwendolyn is quite young and will not comply by having a pH and impedance study probe\nin her system for a few hours, if not 24 hours.\n\n6. At present, there are no indications for me to consider endoscopic assessment as\nGwendolyn does not manifest with significant upper gastrointestinal pain symptoms.\n\nFollow-up\n6 months\u2019 time\n\nHistory/Current Symptoms\n\nThank you for you referral of Gwendolyn, whom | have seen as a new referral in the\ngastroenterology clinic today. She was accompanied by her mum and dad. During the\nconsultation, | understand Gwendolyn was previously under the gastroenterology services at\nAlder Hey for her gastroesophageal reflux disease, which was noted when she was around 3\nmonths of age. At that stage, a minimalistic approach was being maintained, purely because\nshe was gaining weight quite well and the reflux was not impacting on any other systems.\nShe did remain NG-fed until 8 months of age as she had a prolonged Alder Hey Hospital\ninpatient stay to manage her other system issues from a respiratory and ENT point of view.\nGwendolyn\u2019s dad updates me that she has had a tonsillectomy and adenoids removed now.\nA previously attempted pH study, however limited it was, came back normal and hence a\ndecision was taken to take her nasogastric tube out.\n\nCurrently from a reflux point of view, there are concems in the form of Gwendolyn having\nepisodes of vomiting quite often in the week and up to 2-3 times a day. Luckily there is no\nbile or blood in the vomit. Similarly, there are issues with difficulties with night-time sleep on\n\na regular basis. There are also reports of some gagging and choking with both solid and\nliquid food.\n\n", "processed_at": "2025-03-04T06:09:09.108549", "medical_info": {"specialty": {"specialty": "Gastroenterology", "confidence": 80.0}, "personnel": [], "facilities": [{"name": "inpatient stay to manage her other system issues from a respiratory and ENT point of view", "type": "Unknown", "specialty": "Respiratory"}], "events": [{"type": "Appointment", "content": "6 months\u2019 time\n\nHistory/Current Symptoms\n\nThank you for you referral of Gwendolyn, whom | have seen as a new referral in the\ngastroenterology clinic today"}, {"type": "Plan", "content": "6 months\u2019 time\n\nHistory/Current Symptoms\n\nThank you for you referral of Gwendolyn, whom | have seen as a new referral in the\ngastroenterology clinic today"}], "identifiers": {}, "phb_categories": [{"category": "Nutrition", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Problems with intake of food and drink", "confidence": 5.9, "matched_keywords": ["gastro"]}, {"category": "Medication", "severity": "SEVERE", "description": "Drug therapies and medication", "confidence": 5.6, "matched_keywords": ["gastro"]}], "phb_supports": [{"support": "Respite", "description": "Respite: Support & Short-Stay Accommodation/Holiday", "confidence": 4.8, "matched_keywords": ["day"]}]}, "ocr_available": true, "pdf_processing_available": true}}, {"note_id": "a93bebf80eb55c85169658b3d09216ea", "attachment": {"file_name": "Gastro letter Jan 2017 - 3.jpg", "mime_type": "image/jpeg", "file_path": "/Users/adamvialsmoore/Downloads/evernote export/attachments/a93bebf80eb55c85169658b3d09216ea/Gastro letter Jan 2017 - 3_6.jpg", "hash": null, "extracted_text": "Medisec ref 1731499 - Patient AH1565586 (NHSNo 701 057 1422} - Page 3 of 4\n\n| am also informed that Gwendolyn has a dairy intolerance and is currently on Nutramigen 2.\nShe receives around 4-5oz in a day but her solid intake has improved significantly has she is\ngrowing up.

She was asleep for a total\nof 450 minutes she was very disturbed throughout the night but we did see periods of rapid\neye movement which is when problems with obstruction or central apnoeas tend to be\nincreased. Gwendolyn had an average oxygen level of 95% she had two drops in her\noxygen levels one did go down to 81 and the reason for this was not due to apnoeas or\nobstruction the reason for this is unknown. She had a central apnoea hypopnea index of 0.9\nanything less than 1 is normal and that these did not cause drops in her oxygen levels. She\nhad no obstructive apnoeas or hypopneas and she did have some slight episodes of\nparadoxical breathing i.e. seesawing of the tummy and the chest movements which can be\nnormal in little ones less than 3 years and this would be within the normal limit and again this\ncaused no change in her oxygen levels. Her carbon dioxide which has been previously\nraised had an average level of 48 hawever there was a drift towards from the start of the\nstudy to the end of the study and this is probably due to artefact of the machine rather than\nbeing a true reading and there was no correlation with episodes of rapid eye movement.\n\nOverall we noticed that Gwendolyn was restless but there was no obviously trigger for this for.\nthe point of view of her breathing. The study would suggest that the CPAP is effectively\ntreatment her sleep related upper airway obstructive but does not explain the reason for her\ndisturbed sleep and there was no. abnormality of central respiratory drive noted. Therefore\nwe have decided that her CPAP should remain unchanged at the current level and we art\n\neo\n\n", "processed_at": "2025-03-04T06:09:12.448373", "medical_info": {"specialty": {"specialty": "Pulmonology", "confidence": 100}, "personnel": [{"name": "Gwendolyn Vials", "type": "Doctor", "specialty": "Unknown"}], "facilities": [{"name": "Our Ref", "type": "Unknown", "specialty": "Unknown"}, {"name": "No", "type": "Unknown", "specialty": "Unknown"}, {"name": "of Respiratory Medicine\n", "type": "Department", "specialty": "Respiratory"}], "events": [{"type": "General", "content": "Page 1 of 2\n\nAlder Hey Children\u2019s |INHS|\n\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nOur Ref: CH/JLH/AH1565586 Alder Hey\n\nEaton Road\nDate Dictd: 20/03/2017 Liverpool\nDate Typed: 21/03/2017 112 2AP\n\nwww"}, {"type": "General", "content": "She was asleep for a total\nof 450 minutes she was very disturbed throughout the night but we did see periods of rapid\neye movement which is when problems with obstruction or central apnoeas tend to be\nincreased"}, {"type": "General", "content": "Gwendolyn had an average oxygen level of 95% she had two drops in her\noxygen levels one did go down to 81 and the reason for this was not due to apnoeas or\nobstruction the reason for this is unknown"}, {"type": "General", "content": "She\nhad no obstructive apnoeas or hypopneas and she did have some slight episodes of\nparadoxical breathing i"}, {"type": "General", "content": "seesawing of the tummy and the chest movements which can be\nnormal in little ones less than 3 years and this would be within the normal limit and again this\ncaused no change in her oxygen levels"}, {"type": "General", "content": "Her carbon dioxide which has been previously\nraised had an average level of 48 hawever there was a drift towards from the start of the\nstudy to the end of the study and this is probably due to artefact of the machine rather than\nbeing a true reading and there was no correlation with episodes of rapid eye movement"}, {"type": "General", "content": "The study would suggest that the CPAP is effectively\ntreatment her sleep related upper airway obstructive but does not explain the reason for her\ndisturbed sleep and there was no"}, {"type": "General", "content": "Therefore\nwe have decided that her CPAP should remain unchanged at the current level and we art\n\neo"}], "identifiers": {}, "phb_categories": [{"category": "Nutrition", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Problems with intake of food and drink", "confidence": 5.9, "matched_keywords": ["eat"]}, {"category": "Continence", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Continence & toileting needs", "confidence": 5.1, "matched_keywords": ["poo"]}, {"category": "Respiratory", "severity": "SEVERE", "description": "Severe, frequent, hard-to-predict apnoea not related to seizures", "confidence": 26.7, "matched_keywords": ["apnoea", "sleep", "obstruction", "central"]}, {"category": "Medication", "severity": "SEVERE", "description": "Drug therapies and medication", "confidence": 5.6, "matched_keywords": ["increase"]}, {"category": "Mobility", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Mobility impairments", "confidence": 4.4, "matched_keywords": ["move"]}, {"category": "Seizures", "severity": "MODERATE", "description": "Seizure activity", "confidence": 5.6, "matched_keywords": ["episode"]}, {"category": "Behavioral", "severity": "SEVERE", "description": "Behavioral challenges", "confidence": 8.9, "matched_keywords": ["change", "limit"]}, {"category": "Psychological", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Psychological & emotional vulnerability", "confidence": 4.5, "matched_keywords": ["change"]}], "phb_supports": [{"support": "Personal Assistant", "description": "Personal Assistant (PA) for 1:1 or 2:1 Support Outside of School", "confidence": 7.4, "matched_keywords": ["PA"]}, {"support": "Swimming", "description": "Specialist 1:1 Swimming/Hydrotherapy Sessions", "confidence": 4.5, "matched_keywords": ["pool"]}, {"support": "Hippotherapy", "description": "Therapeutic Horse Riding (Hippotherapy)", "confidence": 5.3, "matched_keywords": ["movement"]}]}, "ocr_available": true, "pdf_processing_available": true}}, {"note_id": "94df4fdab90dcc6d81885daa61d18fc4", "attachment": {"file_name": "201713 Gwen profile bed.jpg", "mime_type": "image/jpeg", "file_path": "/Users/adamvialsmoore/Downloads/evernote export/attachments/94df4fdab90dcc6d81885daa61d18fc4/201713 Gwen profile bed_6.jpg", "hash": null, "extracted_text": "Medisec ref 1759043 -

ant\n\nMediser ref 1760453 - Patient AH 1565586 (NHSNo 701 057 1422) - Page 2 of 4\n\nhaving some nose bleeds but she is due a review by Miss De/Mr Street next week and | think\nthis is important just to see what that upper airway looks like. Since then though\nGwendolyn\u2019's compliance with her CPAP has deteriorated. You are struggling to get the\nmask on her. She is quite restless overnight and taking it off and this is confirmed by the\ndownload and for the first time last night you did not proceed with it. There is also some\nfeedback from Zoe's that the ventilator is not supporting her breathing and has been reading\n0. We do know that if the pin is not probably in the vent that it will read 0. However, in the\nbackground you were also saying that there are difficulties in getting Gwendolyn to sleep.\nYou find that this can take several hours but often you will both have to be within the same\nroom even lying down, although it is possible to settle Gwendolyn on her own. It is very\nvariable, she can be in bed asleep by 8.30 pm but it can also be upto midnight but you do\nstart the bedtime routine with Isaac, her older brother, about 7.00 pm including a story but\nthen whereas Isaac will go to sleep on his own Gwendolyn does not. You have had to initiate\nsome of this sleep hygiene and routine away from Isaac as if Gwendolyn becomes very upset\nher cries will then wake up Isaac which is obviously very distressing for the family.\n\nIt sounds though that even once Gwendolyn falls asleep she is not staying asleep and she\nhas frequent awakenings and then takes the mask off. Some of that may be due to gastro-\nintestinal problems and ongoing reflux and the gastroenterology team have increased the\ndose of her Omeprazole, some of it may be that her breathing is not being fully supported. |\nthink it is very difficult to know at the moment but hopefully medically with a repeat sleep\nstudy we can work out what is medical and what is behavioural and probably the two are very\nclosely linked. However, whereas the medical problems we may be able to alter her vent\nsettings the behavioural issues may take longer to fix.\n\nManagement Plan\n\n| know that you have done a self-referral to SCOPE for some sleep behavioural strategies.\nWe obviously work with our psychologist, Clare Chamberlain-Parr, who | think at the moment\nbecause of the connection between the ventilator and sleep and sleep hygiene she is very\nkindly going to initiate some work.\n\nOverall though | know that the lack of sleep and trying to work and having isaac and\nGwendolyn is placing a lot of strain on your family and you have on numerous occasions\nasked for help, | have heard from Mandy Reece regarding the pre-assessment for continuing\nhealth care needs, however, no matter how | score it Gwendolyn would not qualify for\ncontinuing health care needs and you share this view as well. You currently do have respite\ntwo nights a month in Zoe\u2019s Place:\n\nZoe Plan:. We are aiming that Gwendolyn uses her ventilator for more than 4 hours each\nnight, however if after 30 minutes you are unable to put Gwendolyn on her mask then | would\nstop trying. She should then be monitored on her overnight oxygen monitor. If she continues\nto have desaturations below 90% then you should be informed as a family and if she has\ndesaturations into the 80s then she may need to be admitted to hospital.\n\n| will get back to you with the results of the sleep study to see how we can move forward.\nYours sincerely\n\nElectronically checked and authorised by Dr Clare Halfhide\n\nDOr Clare Halfhide\nConsultant in Respiratory Medicine\n", "processed_at": "2025-03-04T06:09:22.008847", "medical_info": {"specialty": {"specialty": "ENT", "confidence": 100}, "personnel": [{"name": "De", "type": "Doctor", "specialty": "Unknown"}, {"name": "Street", "type": "Doctor", "specialty": "Unknown"}, {"name": "Clare Halfhide", "type": "Doctor", "specialty": "Behavioral"}], "facilities": [], "events": [{"type": "Plan", "content": "| know that you have done a self-referral to SCOPE for some sleep behavioural strategies"}], "identifiers": {}, "phb_categories": [{"category": "Respiratory", "severity": "SEVERE", "description": "Severe, frequent, hard-to-predict apnoea not related to seizures", "confidence": 6.7, "matched_keywords": ["sleep"]}, {"category": "Psychological", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Psychological & emotional vulnerability", "confidence": 4.5, "matched_keywords": ["behaviour"]}, {"category": "Behavioral", "severity": "SEVERE", "description": "Behavioral challenges", "confidence": 4.4, "matched_keywords": ["behaviour"]}], "phb_supports": []}, "ocr_available": true, "pdf_processing_available": true}}, {"note_id": "d9e47c9af4e9b39997c4a1b4bb715860", "attachment": {"file_name": "201713 Gwen Halfhide - 1.jpg", "mime_type": "image/jpeg", "file_path": "/Users/adamvialsmoore/Downloads/evernote export/attachments/d9e47c9af4e9b39997c4a1b4bb715860/201713 Gwen Halfhide - 1_6.jpg", "hash": null, "extracted_text": "Rntee ef RMS) Paned AH AASSBR Nets AI UA? 142: Haye tora\n\nAlder Hey Children\u2019s\n\nNHS Foundstion Trust\nOur Ref CH AH 1565586 Alder Hey\nEaton Roed\n\nDate of Clinic 3101/2017 L412 20P\nDate Ota 31/01/2017\n\nweew.aiderhey uk\nDate Typed 21/02/2017 Tet: 0181 Joris\nThe Parent Guarchan of Secretary: Janice Robertson: 0151 252 8166 povtled\nMiss Gwendolyn Vials Moore Fax: 0181\n2 Coronation Dave Amanda Reed: Physiotherapist - 0151 282 6862 (Ext 2962)\nCrosby Decertment of Respiratory Medicine\nLiverpool Long Term Ventilation\nMerseyside Dra SelbyfHelfhide\n123 36N\n\nDear Parent/Guardian of Gwendolyn Vials Moore\n\nGwendolyn Visis MOORE 0.0.8. 22/08/2014\n2 Coronation Hospital No. AH1566686\nCroeby, Liverpool 23 38N NHS No. 761 067 1422\nDiagnosis: Trisomy 21\n\n} gestro-cesophageal reftux disease\n\nMedication: Omeprazole soluble MUPS 10 mg moming, 5 mg at night\nMovicol %-1 sachet daily\nGaviecon 5 mi 4 times a day with meels\n\nPlan: For urgent sleep study to be done on the night of 1 February\nFor ENT review as planned on 7 February\nFor input from our psychology teem regarding 1. initiation of sleep 2.

She was asleep for a total\nof 450 minutes she was very disturbed throughout the night but we did see periods of rapid\neye movement which is when problems with obstruction or central apnoeas tend to be\nincreased. Gwendolyn had an average oxygen level of 95% she had two drops in her\noxygen levels one did go down to 81 and the reason for this was not due to apnoeas or\nobstruction the reason for this is unknown. She had a central apnoea hypopnea index of 0.9\nanything less than 1 is normal and that these did not cause drops in her oxygen levels. She\nhad no obstructive apnoeas or hypopneas and she did have some slight episodes of\nparadoxical breathing i.e. seesawing of the tummy and the chest movements which can be\nnormal in little ones less than 3 years and this would be within the normal limit and again this\ncaused no change in her oxygen levels. Her carbon dioxide which has been previously\nraised had an average level of 48 hawever there was a drift towards from the start of the\nstudy to the end of the study and this is probably due to artefact of the machine rather than\nbeing a true reading and there was no correlation with episodes of rapid eye movement.\n\nOverall we noticed that Gwendolyn was restless but there was no obviously trigger for this for.\nthe point of view of her breathing. The study would suggest that the CPAP is effectively\ntreatment her sleep related upper airway obstructive but does not explain the reason for her\ndisturbed sleep and there was no. abnormality of central respiratory drive noted. Therefore\nwe have decided that her CPAP should remain unchanged at the current level and we art\n\neo\n\n", "processed_at": "2025-03-04T06:09:38.274135", "medical_info": {"specialty": {"specialty": "Pulmonology", "confidence": 100}, "personnel": [{"name": "Gwendolyn Vials", "type": "Doctor", "specialty": "Unknown"}], "facilities": [{"name": "Our Ref", "type": "Unknown", "specialty": "Unknown"}, {"name": "No", "type": "Unknown", "specialty": "Unknown"}, {"name": "of Respiratory Medicine\n", "type": "Department", "specialty": "Respiratory"}], "events": [{"type": "General", "content": "Page 1 of 2\n\nAlder Hey Children\u2019s |INHS|\n\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nOur Ref: CH/JLH/AH1565586 Alder Hey\n\nEaton Road\nDate Dictd: 20/03/2017 Liverpool\nDate Typed: 21/03/2017 112 2AP\n\nwww"}, {"type": "General", "content": "She was asleep for a total\nof 450 minutes she was very disturbed throughout the night but we did see periods of rapid\neye movement which is when problems with obstruction or central apnoeas tend to be\nincreased"}, {"type": "General", "content": "Gwendolyn had an average oxygen level of 95% she had two drops in her\noxygen levels one did go down to 81 and the reason for this was not due to apnoeas or\nobstruction the reason for this is unknown"}, {"type": "General", "content": "She\nhad no obstructive apnoeas or hypopneas and she did have some slight episodes of\nparadoxical breathing i"}, {"type": "General", "content": "seesawing of the tummy and the chest movements which can be\nnormal in little ones less than 3 years and this would be within the normal limit and again this\ncaused no change in her oxygen levels"}, {"type": "General", "content": "Her carbon dioxide which has been previously\nraised had an average level of 48 hawever there was a drift towards from the start of the\nstudy to the end of the study and this is probably due to artefact of the machine rather than\nbeing a true reading and there was no correlation with episodes of rapid eye movement"}, {"type": "General", "content": "The study would suggest that the CPAP is effectively\ntreatment her sleep related upper airway obstructive but does not explain the reason for her\ndisturbed sleep and there was no"}, {"type": "General", "content": "Therefore\nwe have decided that her CPAP should remain unchanged at the current level and we art\n\neo"}], "identifiers": {}, "phb_categories": [{"category": "Nutrition", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Problems with intake of food and drink", "confidence": 5.9, "matched_keywords": ["eat"]}, {"category": "Continence", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Continence & toileting needs", "confidence": 5.1, "matched_keywords": ["poo"]}, {"category": "Respiratory", "severity": "SEVERE", "description": "Severe, frequent, hard-to-predict apnoea not related to seizures", "confidence": 26.7, "matched_keywords": ["apnoea", "sleep", "obstruction", "central"]}, {"category": "Medication", "severity": "SEVERE", "description": "Drug therapies and medication", "confidence": 5.6, "matched_keywords": ["increase"]}, {"category": "Mobility", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Mobility impairments", "confidence": 4.4, "matched_keywords": ["move"]}, {"category": "Seizures", "severity": "MODERATE", "description": "Seizure activity", "confidence": 5.6, "matched_keywords": ["episode"]}, {"category": "Behavioral", "severity": "SEVERE", "description": "Behavioral challenges", "confidence": 8.9, "matched_keywords": ["change", "limit"]}, {"category": "Psychological", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Psychological & emotional vulnerability", "confidence": 4.5, "matched_keywords": ["change"]}], "phb_supports": [{"support": "Personal Assistant", "description": "Personal Assistant (PA) for 1:1 or 2:1 Support Outside of School", "confidence": 7.4, "matched_keywords": ["PA"]}, {"support": "Swimming", "description": "Specialist 1:1 Swimming/Hydrotherapy Sessions", "confidence": 4.5, "matched_keywords": ["pool"]}, {"support": "Hippotherapy", "description": "Therapeutic Horse Riding (Hippotherapy)", "confidence": 5.3, "matched_keywords": ["movement"]}]}, "ocr_available": true, "pdf_processing_available": true}}, {"note_id": "0f400ab2eae81edb78e147169430c223", "attachment": {"file_name": "Gwens new DLA.pdf", "mime_type": "application/pdf", "file_path": "/Users/adamvialsmoore/Downloads/evernote export/attachments/0f400ab2eae81edb78e147169430c223/Gwens new DLA_6.pdf", "hash": null, "extracted_text": "\n[Note: Could not perform OCR on this PDF: Unable to get page count.

Trisomy 21 (Downs Syndrome) screening \u2013 Gwen is at increased risk of health \ncomplications of Trisomy 21 and so has condition specific screening on a yearly \nbasis. Children with Trisomy 21 usually have an IQ in the mild to moderate low range, \nas well as short- and long-term memory problems. Gwen\u2019s learning needs should be \nidentified and managed by the school.  \n5.2. Hearing - Gwen has a history of mild to moderate hearing loss, and has a hearing \ntest completed annually. Gwen is inconsistent in her response to sound which is \nthought to now be mainly due to her concentration and attention difficulties, although \nher hearing can be affected by infections, etc. She would therefore benefit from \nprompting to maintain focus and stay on task.  \n5.3. Vision - Gwen has visual impairment and has worn glasses since 2018 and is under \nophthalmology/orthoptics follow up regularly. She has good functioning visual fields, \nbut the possibility raised of visual field inattention or processing difficulties which will \nbe monitored. Gwen uses an adjusted font size and cannot read menus or basic \nsigns, so for example, lacks the ability to distinguish a shampoo bottle from a harmful \nsubstance. \n5.4. Communication - Gwen can talk using single words or short sentences but reverts to \nusing noise and growls when distressed/for comfort. She has speech delay and is not \neasily understood by all. Gwen can make her basic needs known and can be very \nheadstrong. Gwen can make a structured choice - i.e. \u2018this or this?\u2019, but would not be \nable to respond accurately to \u2018what would you like?\u2019 Gwen does not see animals as \nhaving feelings and frequently doesn\u2019t treat animals well.  Gwen can become \nobsessed over things, such as \u2018The Grinch\u2019 and can say to people that they are not \npermitted to sing because she is more important, lacking any reciprocity in her \ninteraction and failing to engage in shared enjoyment. Her non-verbal communication \nis challenging as she gets extremely frustrated without being able to inform adults of \nwhy, when there is a simple answer. This impacts greatly on all relationships, as her \nfocus is object oriented and having her immediate needs met which can make for \nchallenging interactions and impact upon relationships. Importantly, Gwen has been \nreferred by School back to speech and language both for diction/lack of \nunderstanding and not being able to communicate that/ when she is hurt or what \nhappened. She lacks any sense of danger and where she does not care about it- \nsuch with parents/ carer as stepping into the road and staying there because she has \n\nMedisec ref: 3913557 - Patient: AH1565586 (NHSNo 701 057 1422) -  Page 5 of 11 \n \n \nbeen told not to. It is reported that at School she was asked to show a TA, who had \nreturned from maternity leave her good writing and doodled instead before her 1:1 \nappropriately intervened. It is often reported that Gwen does not have her \u2018listening \nears on\u2019 and is very tired. It is reported that School try to appropriately accommodate \nher and offer her rest/sleep and she refuses sleep even when needed.   \n5.5. Mobility \u2013 Gwen has had mobility problems from birth owing to hypotonia and \nhyperflexes. There are adaptations to the house and specialist equipment to aid \nGwen\u2019s safe mobilisation. She regularly dislocates her joints leading to an osteotomy \nin 2020, which left Gwen with a significant limp. Gwen has different anatomy in a \nnumber of ways, including her bones being flat, not typically round, in profile. Gwen \nhas turns in her feet. Gwen can walk but has always required a wheelchair for any \ndistance.  More recently Gwen required the exceptionally rare procedure of left patella \nstabilisation in April 2022. Subsequently she has required a plaster then splint use \nand wheelchair use. Prior to this, Gwen could walk around the house - slow and \nunsteady, but determined and generally successful in her movement, yet \nexperiencing trips and falls every day requiring adult support to maintain her safe \nmobilisation. Gwen is determined to move under her own steam at home even when \nshe was in a non-weightbearing cast. Following her surgery, Gwen was full time in a \nwheelchair at school and had a physiotherapy plan in place to help recover mobility. \nShe now walks and moves, but is permanently physically disabled in respect of her \nwalking. She is extremely slow indeed, falls and can struggle to get up without help \nand cannot jump at all, but she loves to dance and to be active and to \u2018mess with \neverything\u2019. She will never walk typically due to the above difficulties and low tone \nassociated with Trisomy 21 and still requires access to a Wheelchair.  Her mobility \ndifficulties do not mean that she could not dart into a road, causing traffic to break \nhard, and in fact she has done. Gwen also demonstrates impulsive behaviour and will \nunfasten her wheelchair straps and throw herself out without warning. Gwen is not \nsuitable for a self-propelling/directed wheelchair due to her strength and impulsive \nbehaviours. She currently has a bespoke Mojo wheelchair. Gwen\u2019s body can become \nrigid and as such she can dislocate her joints when stressed. Gwen can also be \nobstructive, such as standing in the road when with carers and refusing to move \nbecause it is a demand to cross the roads.  \n5.6. Sensory - Gwen does not feel or does not care about pain typically and will inflict it \non herself in a sensory seeking manner and will not report it, therefore requires \nsupervision to keep her safe from herself. Gwen has increased sensory needs \n\nMedisec ref: 3913557 - Patient: AH1565586 (NHSNo 701 057 1422) -  Page 6 of 11 \n \n \nassociated with autism and will play inappropriately with faeces, pick at her skin, \nstruggles with hair washing/brushing, and has food obsession.  \n5.7. GI related problems \u2013 Gwen has reflux and constipation requiring daily medication \nwhich is given by an adult. \n5.8. Respiratory related problems \u2013 Gwen has a history of recurrent infections for which \nshe takes prophylactic antibiotics and has sleep apnoea. \n5.9. Sleep \u2013 Gwen has sleep disordered breathing and experiences sleep difficulty which \nis common in children with neurodevelopmental conditions. Gwen requires prompts \nand 1:1 support to go to bed and settle to sleep. She also experiences challenge in \nmaintaining sleep and is often awake in the early hours of the morning where again \nthere are risks to her safety if she is unsupervised. She has woken in the night and \nattempted to leave the house on a  number of occasions wearing only a nightie and \ncarrying a toy shopping basket to go shopping or a backpack trolly with random items \nto go to Disneyland. The house is consequently secured and entries alarmed. She \ncan also get up to cook which on one occasion this resulted in injury. \n \n6. Activities of daily living: \n6.1. Personal care - Gwen requires help with personal cares daily and this should be \nincluded in all support plans to maintain her physical health and wellbeing.  \n6.1.1. Gwen has an adapted bath and shower and needs assistance in getting in and \nout of this, as well as full assistance in washing, dressing and teeth brushing. \n  \n6.1.2. Gwen cannot make clothing choices, cannot fully dress or undress.  \n6.1.3. Gwen needs to be taken to the toilet, which has a supporting toilet frame, as \nshe either has no insight into needing the toilet or refuses to go in order to avoid \nday to day demands placed on her, the urotherapy team meet with Gwen \nregularly for therapy intervention to assist her to know/be in more healthy control \nof her toileting. Attempts to wear a wobl watch to assist this have been \nunsuccessful owing to Gwen\u2019s sensory needs and a request has been made that \nan adult wear this in place of Gwen so that she can be reminded throughout the \nday of when to toilet \u2013 this is necessary at home and in school and will be put in \nto place at the start of next term.  \n\nMedisec ref: 3913557 - Patient: AH1565586 (NHSNo 701 057 1422) -  Page 7 of 11 \n \n \n6.1.4. Gwen experiences constipation and as stated behavioural challenge around \nvoiding her bladder. In view of this she experiences wetting and soiling requiring \nfull care in the toilet and with hand washing, with at least 1:1 but sometimes 2:1, \ndue to both mobility and challenging behaviour.   \n6.1.5. Gwen will smear faeces around the house and so maintaining general hygiene \nfor her and her family is a significant challenge. Gwen cannot clean herself after \ntoileting effectively, she will attempt this and is consistent in soiling clothes, \nsmearing faeces, remaining unclean and putting tissue paper into her bottom.  \n6.1.6. Gwen has experienced recent urinary tract infections which could be linked to \nthis behaviour and so personal hygiene is essential to be maintained.  \n6.1.7. Gwen also has had early menarche and has had menstrual bleeding which \ncomplicates her personal hygiene Gwen has no capacity to tend to this herself. \nThis requirement for care has previously led to her being kept off school and \ndenied access to education in the past \u2013 this is not acceptable, and it is \nunderstood that the inclusion team is/has worked with School to put a policy in \nplace to allow her to attend. The policy was never shared with parents or other \nprovision. It is understood that Gwen no longer bleeds regularly but does bleed \noccasionally/ sporadically, which has not really been an issue in School.   \n6.2. Eating and drinking  \n6.2.1. Gwen will put anything in her mouth and try to eat things which are not edible.  \n6.2.2. Gwen is obsessed with food and remains under CAHMS owing to poor \nbehaviours around food, such as drinking a teachers\u2019 drink at school and then \nvomiting and spoiling another child\u2019s lunch by trying to take it from them, she \nsteals food both in home and school, and has incurred burns from attempting to \nsteal adults\u2019 hot drinks. More recently after stealing a bite of her 1:1s sandwich, \nthe behaviours were reported by School to parents that they had lessened. \nHowever, she went through a number of other children\u2019s School bags recently in \norder to try to steal food. She has also attempted to leave the house with a \nshopping basket to obtain food which is at great risk to her safety and therefore \nrequires constant supervision in all spaces.  \n6.2.3. Gwen can restrict her diet through obsessing over certain foods and her \npreference would be to eat the same foods, rather than a wide variety of foods- \nbeing obsessed with ham and cheese. At the same time she would eat anything \n\nMedisec ref: 3913557 - Patient: AH1565586 (NHSNo 701 057 1422) -  Page 8 of 11 \n \n \nsomeone else had and would crave it and struggle to leave others alone and not \ntake food which is not hers.   \n6.2.4. Gwen is learning to eat better with a knife and fork both at home and at School. \nShe often shovels food at her face, and so is a messy eater and is at risk of \naspiration/choking. She needs constant supervision. Gwen can drink from a cup \nwithout a lid, but almost always requires a straw, she again requires supervision \nwith this as she will spill liquids.  \n6.2.5. Gwen cannot prepare any food or drink, she does not drink enough and seems \nto confuse thirst with hunger.  \n6.2.6. Gwen does not appear to ever feel full, has a food obsession, is obese and is \nunder the care of a dietician, endocrinology and CAMHs therapy.  \n \n \n7. Social and behavioural support: \n7.1. Gwen has complex medical and social needs. These are long standing and will \nrequire long term \u2018round the clock support\u2019 to ensure Gwen is safe, happy and \nthriving; ensuring her physical and emotional needs are met.  \n7.2. Any support plans in place need to take the above complexities into consideration \nalong with her challenging behaviour profile and autism which impacts on her mood \nand behaviour which negatively affects her ability to access a learning environment. \nGiven her medical complexities, Gwen attends multiple health appointments which \nmay impact on her access to learning. Gwen has had a number of operations and her \nhealth needs are ongoing. She has required the input of community Occupational \nTherapy and Physiotherapy for her to be able to safely return to School. When \nattending medical appointments there are adaptations made at Alder Hey, for \nexample, she was recently taken to blood clinic and refused to comply to give blood \nand even with restraint it was not possible to go through with the blood test. The play \nteam / SEN team are involved with Gwen to facilitate her safe access to healthcare.    \n7.3. For the duration of her care under our service, she has received at least 1:1 support, \nrising to 2:1 support given her increasing and significant behavioural challenge in \ninability to maintain any self-safety. Gwen has demonstrated impulsive behaviour \nwhen outside running into the road and running into other people\u2019s houses. This \n\nMedisec ref: 3913557 - Patient: AH1565586 (NHSNo 701 057 1422) -  Page 9 of 11 \n \n \nsupport is included in her school risk assessment and is in place when she is outside \nof her classroom. This limits her access to some activities such as parties and school \ntrips where her safety cannot always be guaranteed owing to her impulsive and \nchallenging behaviour.  \n7.4. Gwen has required a constant 1:1 and a low demand approach to completing the \nmost basic of tasks.  \n7.5. Gwen attends a large number of hospital appointments as well as unscheduled visits \nwhen unwell, her behaviour while in hospital has required specialist input from the \nlearning disabilities team, and sedation due to unsafe behaviours and risk of harm to \nherself from sensory seeking as well as impulsive behaviour. It is noted her \ncompliance is deteriorating with age and she is becoming more demand avoidant. To \nmaintain her safety, even with structure, at least 1:1 is required at all times.  \n7.6. Gwen is a child in need and has a disability Social Worker who supports the family \nand provides 50 hours of funding on a 2:1 basis owing to her complexity and the \nchallenges in keeping her safe. I understand this is a long-standing arrangement and \nprovision is shared with her sibling Isaac who also has challenging needs. Until \nrecently, Gwen accessed Claire House Children\u2019s Hospice also on a 2:1 basis when \noutside the setting and a 1:1 inside at all times, again confirming her challenging \nbehaviour and difficulty maintaining her safety.  Gwen attends Aiming High provision \non a 2:1 basis following their assessment of her needs. Both were already in place \nwhen Child Services undertook their last assessment and so the care provided by \nthose services was not included in their calculation of what was needed to be funded \nby them.   \n7.7. Gwen requires consistent caring relationships which are especially important to her \nemotional wellbeing and enabling her to develop lasting secure relationships with \npeers and carers. Gwen requires a robust framework of support that caters for her \nneeds and ensures she is empowered to reach her academic and social potential. \nChanges can result in school refusal.   \n7.8. Whilst Gwen is headstrong, she benefits from being challenged to learn/develop and \nmaintaining a consistent and routine approach to most things in order for her to feel \ncomfortable and have a sense of control over life and events. Even with this \nconsistency, Gwen can display challenging behaviour which can compromise her \nsafety and the safety of others. Escalation in challenging behaviour can be \nminimised/avoided by ensuring she has a consistent routine and a sense of \n\nMedisec ref: 3913557 - Patient: AH1565586 (NHSNo 701 057 1422) -  Page 10 of 11 \n \n \ninvolvement and control over decisions. Gwen benefits from consistent support and \nfamiliar faces in her support provision.  \n7.9. Gwen is a loving and caring child, who can form relationships over time ensuring \nthere is consistency, and she feels safe. Gwen can behave very well in routine and a \nhighly structured environment with consistent support. She is headstrong and fixed in \nher approach to everything and therefore struggles a great deal with change that she \ndoes not understand, with demands placed on her and with unstructured \nenvironments. This necessitate her being prepared in advance for changes and a low \ndemand approach to any request. In the hospital setting she has, for example, had \nher medical plans changed and adapted on the basis of lack of compliance.  \n7.10. As time has passed, Gwen has required more support and provision has \nincreased in every area of her life. This is required to continue to keep her safe, \nhappy, healthy and meeting her potential. Gwen would thrive with familiar, \nexperienced (those with experience working with children with disabilities and \nneurodevelopmental conditions), and highly structured support with a low demand \napproach.  \n \nYours sincerely \n \nElectronically checked and authorised by Dr N Daniels \n \n \nDr N Daniels \nConsultant Neurodevelopmental Paediatrician  \n \n \nCopy to: \n \n \nDr NA Tong \nBlundellsands Surgery \nBlundellsands \nLiverpool \nL23 6TZ \n \n \n\nMedisec ref: 3913557 - Patient: AH1565586 (NHSNo 701 057 1422) -  Page 11 of 11 \n \n \nF Chikowore \nSocial Worker - Complex Needs \nSocial Services \n3rd Floor \nMagdalen House \n30 Trinity Road \nBootle \nL20 3NJ \n   \n\n", "processed_at": "2025-03-04T06:09:38.620782", "medical_info": {"specialty": {"specialty": "Orthopedics", "confidence": 100}, "personnel": [{"name": "Daniels", "type": "Doctor", "specialty": "Unknown"}, {"name": "Gwendolyn Vials", "type": "Doctor", "specialty": "Unknown"}, {"name": "Daniels", "type": "Doctor", "specialty": "Unknown"}, {"name": "Neurodevelopmental Paediatrician", "type": "Doctor", "specialty": "Unknown"}], "facilities": [{"name": "No", "type": "Unknown", "specialty": "Unknown"}, {"name": "of Developmental Paediatrics \nSefton Team \nPCO for Dr Daniels", "type": "Department", "specialty": "Unknown"}], "events": [{"type": "Medication", "content": "and Physiotherapy for her to be able to safely return to School"}, {"type": "Procedure", "content": "Blundellsands \nLiverpool \nL23 6TZ \n \n \n\nMedisec ref: 3913557 - Patient: AH1565586 (NHSNo 701 057 1422) -  Page 11 of 11 \n \n \nF Chikowore \nSocial Worker - Complex Needs \nSocial Services \n3rd Floor \nMagdalen House \n30 Trinity Road \nBootle \nL20 3NJ \n   \n\n"}], "identifiers": {}, "phb_categories": [{"category": "Mobility", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Mobility impairments", "confidence": 8.9, "matched_keywords": ["physio", "physiotherapy"]}, {"category": "Medication", "severity": "SEVERE", "description": "Drug therapies and medication", "confidence": 5.6, "matched_keywords": ["therapy"]}, {"category": "Continence", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Continence & toileting needs", "confidence": 5.1, "matched_keywords": ["poo"]}], "phb_supports": [{"support": "Hippotherapy", "description": "Therapeutic Horse Riding (Hippotherapy)", "confidence": 5.3, "matched_keywords": ["therapy"]}, {"support": "Swimming", "description": "Specialist 1:1 Swimming/Hydrotherapy Sessions", "confidence": 4.5, "matched_keywords": ["therapy"]}, {"support": "Personal Assistant", "description": "Personal Assistant (PA) for 1:1 or 2:1 Support Outside of School", "confidence": 14.8, "matched_keywords": ["PA", "worker"]}, {"support": "Respite", "description": "Respite: Support & Short-Stay Accommodation/Holiday", "confidence": 14.3, "matched_keywords": ["service", "house", "need"]}]}, "ocr_available": true, "pdf_processing_available": true}}, {"note_id": "91910dd1cdd6a04876c8263031686d8f", "attachment": {"file_name": "All-care-plan-summaries30-01-2023 10-37-41.pdf", "mime_type": "application/pdf", "file_path": "/Users/adamvialsmoore/Downloads/evernote export/attachments/91910dd1cdd6a04876c8263031686d8f/All-care-plan-summaries30-01-2023 10-37-41_6.pdf", "hash": null, "extracted_text": "NHS number: 701 057 142201.

How do these health needs impact on the child\u2019s education/learning?\n\nGwen has complex medical and developmental needs requiring a high level of support and constant supervision to maintain her safety. She has the following confirmed medical background:\n\n1.Trisomy 21 (Down\u2019s syndrome)\n\n2. Hearing impairment - history of mild to moderate hearing loss and will remain under audiology until she is 18 \n\n\n\n3.

Isolated early menarche \n\n14. Behavioural issues with refusal to void her bladder in school, constipation and lack of independent skill to toilet and clean without help.\n\n15. Gwen is also considered a child in need owing to her complexity\n\n\n\nGwen has complex medical and social needs. These are long standing and will require long term \u2018round the clock support\u2019 to ensure Gwen is safe, happy and thriving; ensuring her physical and emotional needs are met. Any support plans in place need to take the above complexities into consideration along with her challenging behaviour profile and autism which impacts on her mood and behaviour which negatively affects her ability to access a learning environment. Given her medical complexities, Gwen attends multiple health appointments which may impact on her access to learning. Gwen has had a number of operations and her health needs are ongoing. She has required the input of community Occupational Therapy and Physio for her to be able to safely return to School. Most recently with a 2:1 for toileting in addition to her normal 1:1. \n\nChildren with Down syndrome usually have an IQ in the mild to moderate low range. Gwen\u2019s learning needs should be identified and managed by the school. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat intervention will be offered to address these needs? Who will provide this? How often and for how long will you offer this intervention?\n\nGwen has follow up from a range of medical specialties to include a Neurodevelopmental Paediatric Clinic at Alder Hey on an at least yearly basis until transition to adult services.\n\nGwen requires consistent caring relationships which are especially important to her emotional wellbeing and enabling her to develop lasting secure relationships with peers and carers. Gwen requires a robust framework of support that caters for her needs and ensures she is empowered to reach her academic and social potential. Whilst Gwen is headstrong, she benefits from being challenged to learn/develop and maintaining a consistent and routine approach to most things in order for her to feel comfortable and have a sense of control over life and events. Even with this consistency, Gwen can display challenging behaviour which can compromise her safety and the safety of others. Escalation in challenging behaviour can be minimised/avoided by ensuring she has a consistent routine and a sense of involvement and control over decisions. Gwen benefits from consistent support and familiar faces in her 1:1 or 2:1 provision. \n\nSupport with health needs:\n\nTrisomy 21 screening \u2013 Gwen is at increased risk of health complications of Trisomy 21 and so has condition specific screening on a yearly basis. \n\nHearing - Gwen has a history of mild to moderate hearing loss. A hearing test is completed annually. Gwen is inconsistent in her response to sound which is thought to be due to her concentration and attention difficulties. She would therefore benefit from prompting to maintain focus and stay on task. \n\nVision - Gwen has worn glasses since 2018 and is under ophthalmology/orthoptics follow up regularly. She has good functioning visual fields, but the possibility raised of visual field inattention or processing difficulties which will be monitored. \n\nCommunication - Gwen can talk in sentences but reverts to using noise and growls when distressed/for comfort. She can make her needs known and can be very headstrong. Gwen can make a structured choice - i.e. \u2018this or this?\u2019, but would not be able to respond accurately to \u2018what would you like?\u2019. Gwen can go rigid and dislocate her joints when stressed. \n\nMobility \u2013 Gwen has had mobility problems from birth owing to hypotonia and being hyperflexive. She regularly dislocates her joints leading to an osteotomy in 2020, which left Gwen with a significant limp. Gwen\u2019s bones are flat not typically round in profile. This is not a feature of Downs Symdrome generally. Gwen has turns in her feet. Gwen can walk but has always required a wheelchair for any distance.  More recently Gwen required the exceptionally rare procedure of  left patella stabilisation  in April 2022, performed by the head of orthopaedics and complex needs team at Alder Hey.   Subsequently she has required a plaster then splint use and wheelchair use. Prior to this, Gwen could walk around the house - slow and unsteady, but determined and generally successful in her movement, yet experiencing trips and falls every day. Gwen is determined to move under her own steam at home even when she was in a non weightbearing cast. Following her surgery, Gwen is full time in a wheelchair at school and has a physiotherapy plan in place to help recover mobility, however, she will never walk typically. Gwen is not suitable for a self-propelling/directed wheelchair and currently has a bespoke Mojo. Gwen has follow up with physiotherapy and orthopaedics. \n\nSensory - Gwen does not feel or does not care about pain typically and will inflict it on herself in a sensory seeking manner and will not report it, therefore requires supervision to keep her safe from herself. \n\nGI related problems \u2013 Gwen has reflux and constipation requiring medication and follow up by the gastrointestinal team.\n\nRespiratory related problems \u2013 Gwen has a history of recurrent infections for which she takes prophylactic antibiotics and had previous sleep apnoea. Gwen has follow up by the respiratory team.\n\n\n\nActivities of daily living:\n\nPersonal care - Gwen requires help with personal cares daily and this should be included in all support plans to maintain her physical health and wellbeing. Gwen needs full assistance in washing, dressing and teeth brushing. Gwen cannot fully dress or undress and she needs to be taken to the toilet as she either has no insight into needing the toilet or refuses to go in order to avoid day to day demands placed on her, the urinary play team are now involved with her care owing to this and are providing her with a special watch to assist her to know/be in more healthy control of her toileting. Gwen experiences constipation and behavioural challenge around voiding her bladder. In view of this she experiences wetting and soiling requiring full care in the toilet and with hand washing, with at least 1:1 but sometimes 2:1, due to both mobility and challenging behaviour. Gwen also has early menarche and bleeds on a monthly basis, although she hasn\u2019t bled since February 2022, Gwen is under both Endochronology and Gynaecology who are clear that they are likely to return.  Gwen has no capacity to tend to this herself. This requirement for care has previously led to her being kept off school and denied access to education \u2013 this is not acceptable and it is understood that the inclusion team is/has worked with School to put a policy in place to allow her to attend. The policy should be shared with parents. \n\nEating and drinking \u2013 Gwen  will put anything in her mouth and try to eat things which are not edible. Gwen is obsessed with food and was referred to CAHMS owing to poor behaviours around food, such as drinking a teachers\u2019 drink at School and then vomiting and spoiling another child\u2019s lunch by trying to take it from them. Her preference would be to eat the same foods, rather than a wide variety of foods- being obsessed with ham and cheese (although not being able to properly digest dairy). Gwen can eat with a spoon and fork if food is cut up into small pieces and can finger feed. She often shovels food at her face, and so is a messy eater and is at risk of aspiration. She needs constant supervision. Gwen can drink from a tommy tippy cup and can now drink from a cup without a lid, but almost always requires a straw, she again requires supervision with this as she will spill liquids. Gwen does not drink enough and seems to confuse thirst with hunger. Gwen does not appear to ever feel full and is under the care of a dietician. \n\n\n\nSocial and behavioural support:\n\nGwen is a child in need and has a disability Social Worker who supports the family and provide 50 hours of funding on a 2:1 basis owing to her complexity and the challenges in keeping her safe. \n\nGwen accessed Claire House Children\u2019s Hospice also on a 2:1 basis when outside the setting and a 1:1 inside at all times. \n\nGwen cannot access  \u2018Jets\u2019 before and after school provision owing to her medical complexity and needs, it being unsafe in their assessment for her to attend without a 1:1 which they refused to provide.  \n\nGwen attends Aiming High provision on a 2:1 basis following their assessment of her needs. \n\nGwen is a loving and caring child, who can form relationships over time and can behave very well in routine and a highly structured environment with consistent support. She is headstrong and fixed in her approach to everything and therefore struggles a great deal with change that she does not understand, transition and with demands placed on her. In the hospital setting, Gwen has recently required sedation due to unsafe behaviours and risk of harm to herself from sensory seeking as well as impulsive behaviour. She has required a constant 1:1 and a low demand approach to completing the most basic of tasks. In recent weeks, Gwen\u2019s behaviours have caused a large number of hospital trips and her behaviour while in hospital has required specialist input and sedation. It is noted her compliance is deteriorating with age and she is becoming more demand avoidant. To maintain her safety, even with structure, at least 1:1 is required at all times. \n\nAs time has passed, Gwen has required more support and provision has increased in every area of her life. This is required to continue to keep her safe, happy, healthy and meeting her potential. Gwen would thrive with familiar and highly structured support with a low demand approach. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the anticipated outcome for the child/young person?\n\nHealth Needs \n\nOutcome\n\nProvision\n\nResources and monitoring \n\nBy whom and how often?\n\nUnder our service, Gwen has Trisomy 21/Down syndrome for which she requires condition specific monitoring as per recommendations by UK Down syndrome interest group\n\nFor Gwen to remain fit and healthy and to achieve her maximum potential\n\nCondition specific monitoring \n\nNeurodevelopmental paediatrician- annual review, Alder Hey\n\n\n\nThese recommendations are based on Gwendolyn\u2019s current level of need, and therefore are likely to change as there is progresses and needs change.

In view of this she experiences wetting and soiling requiring full care in the toilet and with hand washing, with at least 1:1 but sometimes 2:1 due to challenging behaviour. Gwen also has early menarche and bleeds on a monthly basis, with no capacity to tend to this herself. This requirement for care has previously led to her being kept off school and denied access to education \u2013 this is not acceptable. \n\nEating and drinking \u2013 Gwen is a fussy eater and separates all food. She will put anything in her mouth and try to eat things which are not edible. Her preference would be to eat the same foods, rather than a wide variety of foods. Gwen can eat with a spoon and fork if food is cut up into small pieces and can finger feed. She often shovels food at her face, and so is a messy eater and is at risk of aspiration. She needs constant supervision. Gwen can drink from a tommy tippy cup and can now drink from a cup without a lid, she again requires supervision with this as she will spill liquids. \n\n\n\nSocial and behavioural support:\n\nGwen is a child in need and has a disability Social Worker who supports the family and provide 50 hours of funding on a 2:1 basis owing to her complexity and the challenges in keeping her safe. \n\nGwen accessed Claire House Children\u2019s Hospice also on a 2:1 basis when outside and a 1:1 inside at all times. \n\nGwen attends \u2018Jets\u2019 before and after school provision where she has two teaching assistants to maintain her safety. \n\nGwen is a loving and caring child, who can form relationships over time and can behave very well in routine and a highly structured environment with consistent support. She is headstrong and fixed in her approach to everything and therefore struggles a great deal with change, transition and with demands placed on her. In the hospital setting, Gwen has required sedation due to unsafe behaviours and risk of harm to herself from sensory seeking as well as impulsive behaviour. She has required a constant 1:1 and a low demand approach to completing the most basic of tasks. In recent weeks, Gwen\u2019s behaviours have caused a large number of hospital trips and her behaviour while in hospital has required specialist input and sedation. It is noted her compliance is deteriorating with age and she is becoming more demand avoidant. To maintain her safety, even with structure, at least 1:1 is required at all times. \n\nAs time has passed, Gwen has required more support and provision has increased in every area of her life. This is required to continue to keep her safe, happy, healthy and meeting her potential. Gwen would thrive with familiar and highly structured support with a low demand approach. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the anticipated outcome for the child/young person?\n\nHealth Needs \n\nOutcome\n\nProvision\n\nResources and monitoring \n\nBy whom and how often?\n\nUnder our service, Gwen has Trisomy 21/Down syndrome for which she requires condition specific monitoring as per recommendations by UK Down syndrome interest group\n\nFor Gwen to remain fit and healthy and to achieve her maximum potential\n\nCondition specific monitoring \n\nNeurodevelopmental paediatrician- annual review, Alder Hey\n\n\n\nThese recommendations are based on Gwendolyn\u2019s current level of need, and therefore are likely to change as there is progresses and needs change.

She was part of a strong peer group in the nursery environment though she was rarely invited to playdates and selective parties. Gwendolyn is a very kind and friendly little girl who is very good with people. \n\nGwendolyn has complex medical needs, in part attributable to having Downs Syndrome and potentially Cerebral Palsy. Her medical conditions have in the past been classed as 'acute life-threatening' and include respiratory problems, (which have included respiratory arrests), neurological difficulties, differences in anatomy, gastric issues, hearing and visual impairments, difficulties with swallowing, heart issues and mobility issues (for which she has a wheelchair). It is thought that she dislocates her joints when walking (sublux) and additionally her right foot turns in, she has problems with her gait and can walk with her arm raised. She has been a frequent inpatient at Alder Hey and has a co-ordinating consultant in the Long-Term Vent team (she has non-invasive ventilation and complex respiratory problems) owing to the many Disciplines involved in her care. Gwen is allergic to penicillin and unable to have dairy products owing to her inability to break down proteins.\n\n\n\nGwendolyn had received support from the SPOT (Speech and Language, Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy) clinic, and referrals have been made to ensure that the services are provided now that she is at school. She is registered with guide dogs for the blind who can assist adjustments at school for her sight as she grows. She has also been referred to community paediatrics, though she remains under the care of Alder Hey and has had a number of operations (from five different disciplines). These include: (1) a high-resolution MRI of her brain to look for hemiplegia. Other defects save for brain tumour will not be reported as she has clear neurological differences irrespective of any additional diagnosis; (2) investigations in respect of the growth of her airways- ENT are not sure that her airways are growing appropriately with her. Her airways are a different shape so when she gets a cold her airways narrow & she regularly gets croup; (3) a look at & possible lavage of her lungs- she has central and obstructive apnias and requires ventilation when tired/sleeping; (4) a review of her oesophagus/stomach. Gwendolyn has had extensive hospital care since birth with long terms stays and has on a number of occasions almost lost her life. She also has a significant and complex operation planned in the next few months To date Gwendolyn has had a number of operations and is awaiting an MRI scan on her upper spine. \n\nGwendolyn now has a diagnosis of ASD with and is on the ADHD pathway.\n\nThe Endocrinology department is now involved as Gwendolyn has recently started her periods.\n\nGwendolyn is currently under CAMHS and the gynaecology clinics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow best to communicate with the child/young person\n\nGwen receptive language has continued to develop well and she can follow one and two step instructions. When new language is introduced, signing is used to support understanding. Signing can still be used as a prompt. Visuals will be used as a prompt rather than signing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViews, interests and aspirations of child/young person and his/her parent/carer\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\u2019s/Young person\u2019s views \n\nParent\u2019(s)/Carer\u2019(s) views\n\nThings that Gwendolyn is good at\u2026\n\n\n\nPerforming on stage\n\nPerforming in the choir concerts\n\nCounting\n\nSentence writing\n\n\n\nCuddles\n\nReading stories\n\nActing characters especially The Grinch\n\nThings that Gwendolyn really likes\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaying with her friends, especially playing cops and robbers\n\nArt\n\nMaths\n\n\n\nWorking hard\n\nPhonics\n\nSewing\n\nHelping younger children\n\nThings that the Gwendolyn really dislikes\n\n\n\nBeing told off when people don\u2019t play what she wants\n\nBananas\n\nGwendolyn does not like being told what to do when she is tired.\n\nThings that are working well for Gwendolyn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGwendolyn responds well to routine but parents report that she presents with a demand avoidant profile and can be extremely self-directed.\n\nGwendolyn responds well to smaller group environments and parents are really pleased with the progress she has made with her personalised curriculum.\n\nThings that are not working well at the moment for Gwendolyn\n\n\n\nParents are increasingly concerned that Gwendolyn\u2019s current placement in St Nicholas is no longer appropriate. The complexity of her needs mean that Gwendolyn needs a very specific individualised curriculum tailored to her wide range of needs and a that a mainstream school can no longer provide the learning and medical support that she needs.\n\nGwendolyn is due to have major surgery in the coming months and will require extensive support both physically and educationally post-surgery. She will require regular school visits from hospital staff and the use of hoists and other specialist equipment and therefore requires a more specialist school that is located close to Alder Hey Hospital.\n\n\tAspirations/goals for the future\n\n\tFor Gwendolyn\n\n\t\n\nGwendolyn says at various times that she would like to be a Doctor, Hairdresser, carer or work in her brothers restaurant when older as a waiter\n\nParents would like Gwendolyn to achieve as much progress as she is capable of and lead as independent a life as possible.\n\nWhat support/help is required in order to achieve these goals/ aspirations?\n\n\n\nSee Parents comments\n\nParents are requesting a change of placement. They feel a more specialist school located near to Gwendolyn\u2019s hospital team would allow her to return to school post-surgery much more quickly.\n\nChange of placement request discussed in detail for the following reasons:\n\nGwendolyn requires a very specific individualised curriculum to support all areas of her needs. A specialist setting for secondary school would have been requested next year.\n\nGwendolyn requires a specialist setting that will support physical and sensory needs and access to a multi-sensory specialist teacher\n\nGwendolyn has complex medical needs having had at least 12 operations and spent 4 years on ventilation. Her upcoming surgery requires hospital staff to visit her and therefore a school closer her hospital team with an environment more suited to support her mobility post-surgery.\n\nGwendolyn difficulties with mobility have become more significant over recent months and therefore a more suitable environment for students with physical and visual impairments is required. \n\nGwendolyn will need to use a hoist following her operation which was not successful in school after her operation in Year 4  due to the distress it caused Gwendolyn and Mum said that the disabled toilet was not suitable.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nSection B: Educational Needs\n\n\n\n\tMedical/Physical/Sensory Needs\n\n\t Gwendolyn has Downs Syndrome and has complex medical needs.  Gwendolyn has variable conductive hearing loss and has been fitted with bone conducting hearing aids on a soft band but is awaiting a new glasses/hearing aid combination frame. It is important that her BCHA is checked daily and Gwendolyn also has a visual impairment and needs to wear glasses, she can be reluctant to wear both. It should be less of an issue with the combination frames. The reason for the move is that the hearing aids/glasses do not currently fit well together and can slip rendering her unable to hear properly etc. \n\nGwendolyn\u2019s gross and fine motor skills are delayed, although Gwendolyn is able to walk around, she regularly falls which causes her injury. Gwen has a high pain threshold/lack of communication and so does not communicate when hurt or in pain unless it is through learnt behaviour (if another child has been injured at the same time and seeks assistance, she will copy).  Gwen uses a wheelchair, which since starting school she has sat in when tired and used to go between buildings (such as School to church or outside at pick up). She dislocates her joints when walking and can do otherwise. Gwen\u2019s hips are under a huge amount of pressure/wear and consultants are considering a double hip operation.\n\n\tHealth\n\nGwendolyn has recently had a knee operation and is currently in a cast and needs to use her wheelchair at all times in school.\n\nGwendolyn will attempt to move cast and is developing sensory seeking behaviours.\n\nGwendolyn has been discharged from Speech and Language. Occupational Health and physiotherapist will provide a report once the assessment is complete\n\nMrs Nel is going to re refer Gwendolyn for Speech and Language.\n\nGwendolyn is awaiting an appointment after re-referral back to physiotherapy.\n\nGwendolyn has a diagnosis of Trisomy 21 which is also known as Down Syndrome. This is a genetic condition that typically causes some level of learning disability and certain physical characteristics which can affect cardiac, hearing, vision and abdominal health and increases risk of thyroid, joint and spinal problems. For Gwendolyn this includes eye difficulties, hearing difficulties, gastro-oesophageal reflux, obstructive sleep apnoea, bowel difficulties, mobility difficulties, fine and gross motor difficulties, continence difficulties, speech and language difficulties and previous cardiac difficulties. Gwendolyn has had recent input from a guide officer from Guide Dogs.\n\n\n\nGwendolyn was born at 36 weeks and was admitted to the special care baby unit for feeding difficulties. She did not require intubation or ventilation, so it was presumed that she did not sustain any significant hypoxic Ischaemic brain injury. She was last reviewed by the Developmental Paediatrician via telephone contact in April 2019. She was reviewed by the Consultant Paediatric Neurologist in October 2018 and had an MRI brain scan and cervical spine booked. \n\n\n\nGwendolyn has eye difficulties with bilateral hypermetropia with astigmatism. She wears refractory glasses for this condition. She is under the care of the Consultant in Ophthalmology and was last reviewed in January 2019. She had bilateral syringing and probing of nasolacrimal ducts and irrigation of fluorescein was recovered from the nose on both sides. They will endeavour to get a pair of glasses that will fit her BAHA hearing aid coordinating with the dispensing optician from Manchester Royal Eye hospital.\n\n\n\nGwendolyn has hearing difficulties with fluctuating hearing loss from difficulties with glue ear. She was reviewed by the Consultant Audio Vestibular Physician in May 2018 and is awaiting her new spectacles before making an integrate bone conduction hearing aid. She will be reviewed again in February 2019.\n\n\n\nGwendolyn has significant Gastroesophageal reflux. She has medication for this condition.  She is under the care of the Consultant in Paediatric Gastroenterology and was last reviewed in January 2019. She had an upper GI endoscopy, MLTB with biopsies on 30th January 2019 to assess effects of long-term gastro-oesophageal reflux despite on-going anti-reflux medication. There was completely normal appearance of the entire upper GI tract reaching all the way up to the second part of the small bowel. She had assessment of her swallow under the care of the Senior Specialist Speech and Language therapist in April 2018 who found she had a safe swallow with all consistencies and was therefore discharged from this service.\n\n\n\nGwendolyn has obstructive sleep apnoea and is on nocturnal CPAP. She is under the care of the Consultant in Respiratory Medicine and was last reviewed in April 2018. The Consultant Neurodevelopmental Paediatrician referred back to the Respiratory Consultant in April 2019 to see if an independent study was required during her next sleep study to review her symptoms and support review of her medication.  \n\n\n\nGwendolyn has recurrent croup. She is under the care of the Consultant ENT surgeon and was last reviewed in August 2018. She has had previous investigations for the sleep disordered breathing and had an intracapsular adenotonsillectomy in October 2016. She has an omega shaped epiglottis. She had a sleep study in November 2018. \n\n\n\nGwendolyn has recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. She has suffered from recurrent chest infections since infancy. She has trachea-bronchomalasia. \n\n\n\nGwendolyn has bowel difficulties with constipation. She has medication for this condition. She had previous investigation for Hirschprungs disease.  Investigations were normal; however, she will continue to be reviewed if symptoms persist.  She had a rectal biopsy in October 2016.  Following review in May 2018, she was advised to increase her medication. \n\n\n\nGwendolyn has some mobility difficulties with an \u2018immature gait\u2019 and some asymmetry on her right side. She was reviewed by the Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon in March 2018 and referred onto the Neurology Consultants to review her posturing. She was reviewed by Consultant Paediatric Neurologist in October 2018 and found to have a symmetrical gait, mild diffused hypotonia, but no evidence of any brain injury to result in the reported asymmetry of gait. Gwen is under the care of the Paediatric Orthopaedic Consultant and was reviewed in clinic in January 2019. Gwen is receiving regular monitoring under the team. Physiotherapy was discussed and it was concluded that physiotherapy would not be necessary due to Gwen being relatively mobile. Gwen\u2019s family pay for Piedro boots to support Gwen with her walking, it was advised these should be made available via the Orthotics team. Gwen has been referred to the Orthotics team for further assessment and review. \n\n\n\nGwendolyn has fine and locomotor difficulties. She is under the care of the Occupational therapist, who is providing support for functional independence, communication and interaction skills. She was last reviewed in August 2018. She has a Heathfield chair to support her comfort and the equipment has been updated to a larger one to support her needs.  \n\n\n\nGwendolyn is under the care of the Children\u2019s Continence Service. She has continence difficulties. She is able to use the toilet throughout the day but uses the potty at home and refuses to use the toilet. She is not in nappies during the day but has regular accidents. Gwen is not dry yet through the night and wears pull ups at bedtime.  She has been referred to the continence service and is currently waiting for a home visit for support and advice. At school Gwendolyn is becoming more independent with her toileting and personal care but still requires support from an adult.\n\n\n\nGwendolyn has Speech and Language difficulties. She is under the care of the Speech and Language therapist and was last reviewed in July 2018.  In April 2021\n\n\n\n\tGwendolyn had previous cardiac difficulties with a Patent Ductus Arteriosis and a Patent Foramen Ovale. She was last reviewed by the Consultant Paediatric Cardiologist in February 2019 due to concerns over heart rhythm. Following a 24 hour recording, there were no concerns found. The Consultant advised if there were any further concerns or new symptoms he would investigate.\n\n\t\n\n\tDr Daniels update (May 21) See update received 29/06/2022\n\n\tSchool Gwen attends St Nicholas Primary. Gwen is settled back into school and has an EHCP meeting due next week \u2013 parents feel continuation of a consistent 1:1 would benefit Gwen and they would like support with personal care to be explicit in the plan. Health After a recent orthopaedic review, it was noted that Gwen has a different unstable gait and there have been some concerns about possible axial myopathy and some laxity around Gwen\u2019s neck, she has had an X-ray of her cervical spine which has demonstrated - The alignment of the cervical spine is preserved on dynamic study. The atlantodental distance is within normal limits. No abnormal prevertebral soft tissue swelling noted. An MRI scan under general anaesthetic to assess this in greater detail is pending. ND v1.1 Page 3 of 4 Thyroid screening is required every 2 years. Gwen has this checked on 25/6/2020 and within normal limits with TSH 2.37, T4 11.4. A full blood count was also checked on 25/6/2020 \u2013 This is overall in expected limits for a child with Trisomy 21 with a slightly low white cell count (4.7). Gwen has a history of mild hearing loss and wears bilateral contact mini hearing aid. A hearing test was completed in April 2021 showing satisfactory hearing, and will be repeated in 6 months. Gwen has worn glasses since 2018 and is under ophthalmology/orthoptics follow up regularly. She was last seen December 2020 with good functioning visual fields but the possibility raised of visual field inattention or processing difficulties which will be monitored. Gwen has been added to the wait list today for assessment of her social communication as the possibility of Autism Spectrum Condition (ASD) has been raised. Communication Gwen can talk in sentences but has reverted to using noise and growls when distressed/for comfort. She can make her needs known and can be very headstrong. Activities of daily living Gwen can walk but is very slow and she has a wheelchair. Around the house she can walk in a fashion \u2013 slow and unsteady. She is determined and generally successful in her movement but experiences trips and falls every day. Gwen needs full assistance in washing, dressing and teeth brushing. She needs to be taken to the toilet as she has no insight into needing the toilet. In view of this she experiences wetting and soiling requiring full care in the toilet and with hand washing. She can eat with a spoon and fork if food is cut up into small pieces and can finger feed although at risk of aspiration and so needs constant supervision. Gwen can drink from a tommy tippy cup and can now drink from a cup without a lid, she again requires supervision with this as she will spill liquids. Gwen can make a structured choice \u2013 i.e. \u2018this or this?\u2019, but would not be able to respond accurately to \u2018what would you like?\u2019 Diet Gwen is becoming fussier over time with her approach to food and separating everything. She will put anything in her mouth, try to eat things which are not human food. Her preference would be to eat the same foods, rather than a wide variety of foods.\n\n\t\n\n\tSupport in place \n\n\tDLA, EHCP in place and due a review. Support worker and CIN plan in place. ND v1.1 Page 4 of 4 Summary Gwen has complex medical and social needs. These are long standing and will require long term \u2018round the clock support\u2019 to ensure Gwen is safe, happy and thriving ensuring her physical and emotional needs are met. Any support plans in place need to take the above complexities into consideration along with her emerging social communication difficulties which will soon be assessed. Gwen requires consistent caring relationships which are especially important to her emotional wellbeing and enabling her to develop lasting secure relationships with peer and carers. Gwen requires a robust framework of support that caters for her needs and ensures she is empowered to reach her academic and social potential. Whilst Gwen is headstrong, she benefits from being challenged to learn/develop and maintaining a consistent and routined approach to most things in order for her to feel comfortable and have a sense of control over life and events. Without this consistency, she can display challenging behaviour. Escalation in challenging behaviour can be minimised/avoided by ensuring she has a consistent routine and a sense of involvement and control over decisions. Gwen requires help with personal cares daily and this should be included in all support plans to maintain her physical health and wellbeing. Given her medical complexities, Gwen attends multiple health appointments which may impact on her access to learning.\n\n\t\n\n\tTrisomy 21 \u2013 Down Syndrome.\n\n\tEye difficulties \u2013 wears refractory glasses.\n\n\tHearing difficulties \u2013 awaiting uses bone conduction hearing aids and has periods of time when she uses them. \n\n\tSignificant Gastroesophageal reflux \u2013 medication - Omeprazole soluble MUPS 10mg twice a day and Gaviscon 5ml 4 times a day with meals. \n\n\tObstructive sleep apnoea. \n\n\tLower respiratory tract infections. \n\n\tConstipation \u2013 medication \u2013 Movicol 1-2 sachets daily. \n\n\tMobility difficulties. \n\n\tFine and locomotor difficulties. \n\n\tContinence difficulties. \n\n\tSpeech and Language difficulties.\n\n\t\n\n\tCommunication and Interaction \n\n\t \n\n\tCommunication and Interaction \n\nGwendolyn\u2019s use of language is developing and she uses some single words and can put two/ three words together but often not clearly. Gwendolyn\u2019s verbal communication is delayed however her signing is good however she usually communicates verbally and is encouraged to do so.\n\nHer understanding is regarded as being good and she can follow 1 to 2 step instructions. Gwendolyn will initiate interactions through vocalisations, tapping arms, gestures, pointing and taking adults by the hand. Sign along means the words she knows well are dropped and focus is put on signs which needs to be developed, as people cannot sign as quickly as they talk. Gwendolyn\u2019s vocalisations tend to be accompanied by her signing and she has a wider range of signs than words at present. \n\n\tGwendolyn has a good understanding of what people are saying to her, and can use Makaton and Singalong.\n\nDue to her hearing and physical disabilities, it is difficult for Gwendolyn to make some sounds, for example she cannot articulate the 'g' sound. Gwendolyn's levels of hearing fluctuate and her levels of responsiveness vary accordingly. Nursery report that Gwendolyn has difficulty with her communication and language. They highlight that she is unable without support to make her wants and feelings known. Gwendolyn has very limited vocabulary and will use sign language to communicate her needs. Nursery Adults report that Gwendolyn does not communicate pain like other children so unless witnessed it is not possible to know if she is hurt/sick. Gwendolyn is beginning to make her wants and feelings known.\n\nGwendolyn communicates her needs well.\n\n\t\n\n\tEarly years setting report that at age 42 months Gwendolyn was working at E2 for Listening, E1 for Understanding C2 for Speaking.\n\n\t\n\n\tCognition and Learning \n\nDr Stuart Duckworth (Educational psychologist) reported that although Gwendolyn has global development delay, she is cognitively able and tracking well in many areas, she is reported to love stories and picture books and will engage with this for prolonged periods. She has also begun to enjoy dressing up although does not do so in terms of role-play. Parents have also identified that Gwendolyn is beginning to develop early pretend play skills such as feeding her stuffed animals and sometimes using objects as part of symbolic play. \n\nEleanor Boylan (Educational psychologist) has undertaken a recent assessment with Gwendolyn and has supported with suggested new outcomes for her plan. Report to follow.\n\n\n\nEarly Years setting report that aged 42 months Gwendolyn was working at E1 for Reading, D1 for Writing, C1 for Number, C3 for Shape, Space and Measure. For Expressive Art and Design, she was working at E1 for Exploring using Media and Materials, E1 for Being Imaginative. \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\nSocial, Emotional and Mental Health\n\nGwendolyn interacts well with other children although she can sometimes struggle to follow the rules of the game. She is happy and outgoing in her approach to adults, peers and her surroundings. Gwendolyn is keen to explore the learning environment in its entirety and is also keen to respond to the activities presented to her. She can sometimes be a little 'stubborn' although this was not regarded as a significant issue in nursery school it has been problematic in school- though school have dealt with it well. Gwendolyn is regarded as having her own mind but can be gently persuaded to partake in suggested activities and if bad behaviour is ignored, she stops. She has a particular passion for cleaning tables and making sure things are tidied away. Gwendolyn is keen to come for the children when they are upset and is very affectionate to the majority of people she meets. Gwendolyn has beautiful manners and always wants to help others and engages in an emotionally positive way. She is beginning to develop her expression of different emotions.\n\n\t\n\n\tNursery highlight that Gwendolyn struggles with dealing with her emotions, i.e. anxiety, frustration and uncertainty which requires adult intervention / support. \n\n\t\n\n\tEarly years setting report that aged 42 months Gwendolyn in assessment of Understanding of the World she was working at D1 for People and Communities, D2 for The World, C3 for Technology. \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\nSummary of Special Educational Needs\n\nGwendolyn has complex health and education needs but is continuing to make a good progress as a result of the individualised curriculum planned for her. The increasing challenges with mobility and health mean that she now requires support from a more specialist setting in order to meet her needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea of need  \n\nProgress against outcomes\n\nCommunication and Interaction\n\n\n\nGwendolyn will be able to express wants, needs, likes and dislikes. \n\nGwen can express her wants, needs and likes. She cannot always say why she may feel sad or dislikes something. Gwen is excellent at expressing her views and prefers to talk than sign, she is very verbal but doesn\u2019t like to say anything she dislikes\n\nGwendolyn will continue to develop an understanding of language to the three key word level and beyond. \n\n\n\nGwen has a good understanding of language but struggles with clarity in her speech.\n\nGwen\u2019s communication has improved significantly.\n\nMargaret Dutton was instrumental with Gwen\u2019s improvement.\n\nFurther support required from the Speech and Language service is required to ensure there are clearer outcomes for Gwen\u2019s communication.\n\nGwendolyn will be able to communicate her thoughts and needs through the use of sign and verbalisation.\n\n\n\nGwen prefers to communicate verbally rather than to sign. She is always eager to express her thoughts in lessons.\n\nGwen responds really well to working in a group and can work independently for up to 15 minutes.\n\nGwendolyn will continue to be able to predict and understand the expectations and routines of her educational environment.\n\nGwen works well within a structured environment and can transition easily within her routine. She can be very self-directed and refuse to comply in new unfamiliar environments.\n\nGwen is not obsessed with timetables and picks things up easily. Gwen operates in the here and now and finds the concept of time challenging. She struggles to talk about the recent past. \n\nCognition and Learning\n\n\n\nGwendolyn will achieve her learning potential.\n\n\n\nGwen can work for longer periods of time but she still needs adult support and prompting. She has made good progress towards the targets set on her SEN Support Plan and enjoys learning.\n\nGwendolyn will develop her pretend play skills.\n\n\n\nGwen has a great imagination and loves pretend play. She is happy to play with others but can at times become very self-directed.\n\nGwendolyn will be able to match and sort according to shape and colour.\n\n\n\nGwen has a good understanding of common 2D shapes and colours.\n\n\n\nSocial, Emotional and Mental Health\n\n\n\nGwendolyn will feel happy, included and safe.\n\n\n\nGwen is very happy in school and has never expressed feelings of being unsafe. She has a good relationship with her familiar adults.\n\nGwendolyn will enjoy reciprocal social interactions with adults and peers.\n\nGwen loves to be with adults and her peers and has developed many positive relationships with the children and adults she works with. She does become more anxious in new setting and will therefore require support when moving to a new setting.\n\nGwendolyn will display an emerging understanding of emotions and ability to respond to adult requests.\n\n\n\nGwen has a good understanding of positive emotions within herself but struggles to identify anything that may be a negative emotion.

She has regular sensory breaks and a varied sensory diet in the Rainbow Room. Gwen often requires 2:1 for her toileting needs in school.\n\n\n\nAdvice provided by the following agencies should be followed; QTVI ToD \u2022 SaLT \u2022 OT \u2022 Physiotherapy \u2022 Medical professionals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea of Need\n\nSuggested new outcomes\n\nCommunication and Interaction\n\nGwendolyn will be able to express wants, needs, likes and dislikes and begin to discuss things that worry her.\n\n\n\nGwendolyn will be able to her express her needs and wants with increasing clarity to more unfamiliar adults.\n\n\n\nGwendolyn will continue to be able to predict and understand the expectations and routines of a new educational environment.\n\nCognition and Learning\n\nGwendolyn will develop functional skills that will allow her to stay safe and develop her independence skills.

There were some concerns that following her\n\npatellar stabilisation that the patella might be subluxing or dislocating. She has had problems\n\nwith her knee brace pretty much since we started using it a month ago.\n\nClinical examination today shows that in extension the patella is nice and central and there is\nsome slight lateral movement as you go into flexion which you can cheat about 90\u00b0 but this is\ndue to the fact that she has a flat trochlea with no lateral buttress. The vastus medialis is\n\nholding in check.\n\nKnee braces have never been particularly effective as they always fall down and she has\nbroken a few on occasion and tends to take them off and she hates them . | think we might\nas well abandon these now at 10 weeks and just to let her get working on her quadriceps\nstrength.
